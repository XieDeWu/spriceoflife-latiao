This mod is an extension of the Spice of Life series and adds three new mechanics along with their corresponding configuration files:

### 1. Dynamic adjustment of food values
The hunger (food level), saturation, and eating time of foods will be dynamically modified.
Repeatedly eating the same food will gradually reduce its restoration amount.

### 2. Natural hunger
Over time, the player’s food level will slowly decrease.

### 3. Sleep
After waking up from sleep, the player will lose food level proportionally to the amount of time slept.
